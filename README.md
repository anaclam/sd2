# Check to see if you have git installed. 
# Instructions are for Mac but should work for Linux too. If you're on
# MS-DOS you're gonna have to look up instructions haha
# 1) Open up a terminal window
# 2) Type "which git" and it will tell you where the files are located 
#    if you have it.
# 3) Assuming you have it, check the version by typing "git --version"
# 4) If you don't have git or the version isn't the latest one (2.8.whatever)
#    then download it (https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it.
# 5) Restart your computer and follow steps 2 and 3 again to make sure 
#    the install went okay.

# Make a directory to store your code.
# 1) In the terminal window, type in "pwd" to see your working path.
# 2) Type "ls" to see what folders/directories are availabe.
# 3) Type "cd <name_of_folder>" to go into the directory you want. Repeat 
#    steps until you get where you want to make your folder to store the code.
# 4) Type "mkdir <name_of_new_folder_for_code>" 
# 5) cd into that new folder
